This project processes meteorite landing data from a text file, filtering meteorites based on mass and year of landing. 
It reads, parses, and organizes the data using a `MeteorDataEntry` class.

- Reads meteorite landing data from a text file (`meteorite_landings_data.txt`).
- Filters meteorites with:
- Mass greater than **2,900,000g** (2.9 metric tons).
- Landing year **2013 or later**.
- Stores data using a `MeteorDataEntry` class.
- Ensures missing data fields are handled gracefully.
- Prints filtered meteorite entries in a readable format.
